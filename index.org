* Autotuning Research Group of the University of São Paulo
The Autotuning  Research Group (ARG)  is based at  the University of  São Paulo,
Brazil, and was created in January  2020 with the objective of studying computer
program  autotuning  using meta-heuristics,  design  of  experiments, and  other
statistical optimization methods.

Here you  will find a list  of our members and  their work, as well  as links to
autotuning and statistical libraries, books and interesting papers.

We  currently have  an  open call  for proposals,  with  5 funding  scholarships
available for undergrad, masters and PhD students.
