# Concepts for Autotuning

This  is a  list  of concepts  useful  for  autotuning in  the  context of  this
project. This is a living list, with  links for resources and new items added as
needed. The  purpose of this list  is to provide an  easily accessible reference
for the concepts involved in autotuning.
